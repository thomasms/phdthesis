% Thesis Acknowledgements ------------------------------------------------
\begin{acknowledgements}
I would like to firstly acknowledge my supervisors, Dr Neil McCauley and Dr Jon Coleman, for their wealth of knowledge on the subject of neutrinos and particle physics. You have provided me with much needed help though the entirety of my PhD. I would also like to thank the neutrino group, especially Prof. Christos Touramanis, for his wisdom and guidance throughout my PhD. The neutrino weekly meetings were an important date in my calendar and although they often ran far too long they were key in helping me resolve some problems along the way.

Fellow PhD students, both young and old, too many to name here but a few who made it an enjoyable experience, thanks Mike, Allan, Adrian, Oliver, Matt, Rob, John, Aaron, James, Abdi, Graham. Also some notable thanks to the post doctoral community at Liverpool: George, Matt, Steve, Joe, Kostas.

I would also like to acknowledge the Hep football team for the enjoyable but sometimes dangerous weekly football games that helped me survive the tough weeks at work. However it leaves me with some regret that over the three years we did not win the Bubble Chamber tournament, but playing in the final gives me some solace.

Of course this thesis would never have happened if it was not for the support of my family and my girlfriend Els, thank you.
